Minimum gyro sensitivity when turning controller at or below MIN_GYRO_THRESHOLD.\nYou can assign a second value as a different vertical sensitivity.
Maximum gyro sensitivity when turning controller at or above MAX_GYRO_THRESHOLD.\nYou can assign a second value as a different vertical sensitivity.
Sets a gyro sensitivity to use. This sets both MIN_GYRO_SENS and MAX_GYRO_SENS to the same values. You can assign a second value as a different vertical sensitivity.
Degrees per second at and below which to apply minimum gyro sensitivity.
Degrees per second at and above which to apply maximum gyro sensitivity.
Power curve for stick input when in AIM mode. 1 for linear, 0 for no curve (full strength once out of deadzone). Higher numbers make more of the stick's range appear like a very slight tilt.
Stick sensitivity when using classic AIM mode.
Calibration value mapping mouse values to in game degrees. This value is used for FLICK mode, and to make GYRO and stick AIM sensitivities use real world values.
With a virtual controller, how fast a full tilt of the stick will turn the controller, in degrees per second. This value is used for FLICK mode with virtual controllers and to make GYRO sensitivities use real world values.
Set this value to the sensitivity you use in game. It is used by stick FLICK and AIM modes as well as GYRO aiming.
Set this to a value between 0 and 1. This is the threshold at which a soft press binding is triggered. Or set the value to -1 to use hair trigger mode
When in AIM mode, set stick X axis inversion. Valid values are the following:\nSTANDARD or 1, and INVERTED or -1
Set gyro X axis inversion. Valid values are the following:\nSTANDARD or 1, and INVERTED or -1
Set gyro Y axis inversion. Valid values are the following:\nSTANDARD or 1, and INVERTED or -1
Sets how long a flick takes in seconds. This value is used by stick FLICK mode.
Applies a delta exponent to flick_time, effectively making flick speed depend on the flick angle: use 0 for no effect and 1 for linear. This value is used by stick FLICK mode.
This length of the smoothing window in seconds. Smoothing is only applied below the GYRO_SMOOTH_THRESHOLD, with a smooth transition to full smoothing.
When the controller's angular velocity is below this threshold (in degrees per second), smoothing will be applied.
Gyro deadzone. Gyro input will be ignored when below this angular velocity (in degrees per second). This should be a last-resort stability option.
Below this threshold (in degrees per second), gyro sensitivity is pushed down towards zero. This can tighten and steady aim without a deadzone.
When in AIM mode and the stick is fully tilted, stick sensitivity increases over time. This is a multiplier starting at 1x and increasing this by this value per second.
When in AIM mode and the stick is fully tilted, stick sensitivity increases over time. This value is the maximum sensitivity multiplier.
Defines a radius of the left stick within which all values will be ignored. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small. Stick input out of this radius will be adjusted.
Defines a distance from the left stick's outer edge for which the stick will be considered fully tilted. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small. Stick input out of this deadzone will be adjusted.
Defines a minimum angle (in degrees) for the flick to be considered a flick. Helps ignore unintentional turns when tilting the stick straight forward.
Defines a radius of the right stick within which all values will be ignored. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small. Stick input out of this radius will be adjusted.
Defines a distance from the right stick's outer edge for which the stick will be considered fully tilted. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small. Stick input out of this deadzone will be adjusted.
Defines a distance from both sticks' outer edge for which the stick will be considered fully tilted. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small. Stick input out of this deadzone will be adjusted.
Defines a radius of the motion-stick within which all values will be ignored. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small. Stick input out of this radius will be adjusted.
Defines a distance from the motion-stick's outer edge for which the stick will be considered fully tilted. Stick input out of this deadzone will be adjusted.
Defines an angle within which _ANGLE_TO_X and _ANGLE_TO_Y stick modes will be ignored (in degrees). Since a circular deadzone is already used for deciding whether the stick is engaged at all, it's recommended not to use an inner angular deadzone, which is why the default value is 0.
Defines an angle from max or min rotation that will be treated as max or min rotation, respectively, for _ANGLE_TO_X and _ANGLE_TO_Y stick modes. Since players intending to point the stick perfectly up/down or perfectly left/right will usually be off by a few degrees, this enables players to more easily hit their intended min/max values, so the default value is 10 degrees.
How far the controller must be leaned left or right to trigger a LEAN_LEFT or LEAN_RIGHT binding.
Let the stick modes account for how you're holding the controller:\nFORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, BACKWARD
How gyro input is converted to 2D input. With LOCAL, your MOUSE_X_FROM_GYRO_AXIS and MOUSE_Y_FROM_GYRO_AXIS settings decide which local angular axis maps to which 2D mouse axis.\nYour other options are PLAYER_TURN and PLAYER_LEAN. These both take gravity into account to combine your axes more reliably.\n\tUse PLAYER_TURN if you like to turn your camera or move your cursor by turning your controller side to side.\n\tUse PLAYER_LEAN if you'd rather lean your controller to turn the camera.
Choose the rate at which trackball gyro slows down. 0 means no decay, 1 means it'll halve each second, 2 to halve each 1/2 seconds, etc.
Indicate your monitor's horizontal resolution when using the stick mode MOUSE_RING.
Indicate your monitor's vertical resolution when using the stick mode MOUSE_RING.
Pick a radius on which the cursor will be allowed to move. This value is used for stick mode MOUSE_RING and MOUSE_AREA.
Some smoothing is applied to flick stick rotations to account for the controller's stick resolution. This value overrides the smoothing threshold.
If FLICK_SNAP_MODE is set to something other than NONE, this sets the degree of snapping -- 0 for none, 1 for full snapping to the nearest direction, and values in between will bias you towards the nearest direction instead of snapping.
Sets the amount of time in milliseconds within which the user needs to reach the full press to skip the soft pull binding of the trigger.
Sets the time in milliseconds to wait between each turbo activation.
Sets the amount of time in milliseconds to hold a button before the hold press is enabled. Releasing the button before this time will trigger the tap press. Turbo press only starts after this delay.
Sets the amount of time in milliseconds within which both buttons of a simultaneous press needs to be pressed before enabling the sim press mappings. This setting does not support modeshift.
Sets the amount of time in milliseconds within which the user needs to press a button twice before enabling the double press mappings. This setting does not support modeshift.
Sets the time in milliseconds that JoyShockMaper waits before reading from each controller again.
Changes the color bar of the DS4. Either enter as a hex code (xRRGGBB), as three decimal values between 0 and 255 (RRR GGG BBB), or as a common color name in all caps and underscores.
Scrolling sensitivity for sticks.
Enable or disable device hotplugging. Valid values are ON and OFF.
When TOUCHPAD_MODE is set to GRID_AND_STICK, this variable sets the number of rows and columns in the grid. The product of the two numbers need to be between 1 and 25.
Assign a mode to the touchpad. Valid values are GRID_AND_STICK or MOUSE.
Sets the ring mode for the touch stick. Valid values are INNER and OUTER
Set a mouse mode for the touchpad stick. Valid values are the following:\nNO_MOUSE, AIM, FLICK, FLICK_ONLY, ROTATE_ONLY, MOUSE_RING, MOUSE_AREA, OUTER_RING, INNER_RING
Sets the radius of the circle in which a touch stick input sends no output.
Set the radius of the touchpad stick. The center of the stick is always the first point of contact. Use a very large value (ex: 800) to use it as swipe gesture.
Changes the sensitivity of the touchpad when set as a mouse. Enter a second value for a different vertical sensitivity.
JSM will be hidden in the notification area when minimized if this setting is ON. Otherwise it stays in the taskbar.
Sets the vigem virtual controller type. Can be NONE (default), XBOX (360) or DS4 (PS4).
Dual stage mode for the touchpad TOUCH and CAPTURE (i.e. click) bindings.
Disable the rumbling feature from vigem. Valid values are ON and OFF.
Control the adaptive trigger feature of the DualSense. Valid values are ON and OFF.
Sets the adaptive trigger effect on the left trigger:\n
OFF: No effect\n
ON: Use effect generated by JSM depending on ZL_MODE\n
RESISTANCE start[0 9] force[0 8]: Some resistance starting at point\n
BOW start[0 8] end[0 8] forceStart[0 8] forceEnd[0 8]: increasingly strong resistance\n
GALLOPING start[0 8] end[0 9] foot1[0 6] foot2[0 7] freq[Hz]: Two pulses repeated periodically\n
SEMI_AUTOMATIC start[2 7] end[0 8] force[0 8]: Trigger effect\n
AUTOMATIC start[0 9] strength[0 8] freq[Hz]: Regular pulse effect\n
MACHINE start[0 9] end[0 9] force1[0 7] force2[0 7] freq[Hz] period: Irregular pulsing
Sets the adaptive trigger effect on the right trigger:\n
ON: Use effect generated by JSM depending on ZR_MODE\n
Gyro calibration happens automatically when this setting is ON. Otherwise you'll need to calibrate the gyro manually when using gyro aiming.
When outputting as a virtual controller, account for this much inner deadzone being applied in the target game. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small.
When outputting as a virtual controller, account for this much outer deadzone being applied in the target game. This value can only be between 0 and 1 but it should be small.
When outputting as a virtual controller, account for this power curve being applied in the target game.
When outputting as a virtual controller, use this to adjust the scale of the left stick output. This does not affect the gyro->stick conversion.
When outputting as a virtual controller, use this to adjust the scale of the right stick output. This does not affect the gyro->stick conversion.
When using the WIND stick modes, this is how many degrees the stick has to be wound to cover the full range of the ouptut, from minimum value to maximum value.
Power curve for WIND stick modes, letting you have more or less sensitivity towards the neutral position.
How quickly the WIND sticks unwind on their own when the relevant stick isn't engaged (in degrees per second).
Whether gyro should be converted to mouse, left stick, or right stick movement. If you don't want to use gyro aiming, simply leave GYRO_SENS set to 0.
Whether flick stick should be converted to a mouse, left stick, or right stick movement.
If AUTOLOAD doesn't work properly, set this value to the path to the directory holding the JoyShockMapper.exe file. Make sure a folder named \"AutoLoad\" exists there.
Stick sensitivity of the relative movement when in HYBRID_AIM mode. Like the sensitivity of a mouse.
In HYBRID_AIM stick mode, select the mode's behaviour in the deadzone.\n
This deadzone is determined by the angle of the output from the stick position to the center.\n
It is fully active up to RETURN_DEADZONE_ANGLE and tapers off until RETURN_DEADZONE_CUTOFF_ANGLE.\n
When in DEADZONE_INNER it transitions to an output deadzone based on the distance to the center so the relative part of the input smoothly fades back in.
In HYBRID_AIM stick mode, enables continuous travelling when the stick is at the edge.
In HYBRID_AIM stick mode, angle to the center in which the return deadzone is still partially active.\n
Valid values range from 0 to 90
In HYBRID_AIM stick mode, angle to the center in which the return deadzone is fully active.\n
